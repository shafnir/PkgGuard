# üõ°Ô∏è PkgGuard: Package Trust for VS Code

**PkgGuard** is your modern security companion for Python and JavaScript/TypeScript development in VS Code. Instantly see the trustworthiness of your dependencies‚Äîright in your editor.

## üöÄ Overview
PkgGuard analyzes your import statements and gives you real-time trust scores, risk factors, and direct links to package registries and GitHub. Stay safe, code with confidence, and never get caught off guard by a risky dependency again.

> **Note:** PkgGuard is designed to protect you from AI hallucinations and package authenticity issues. It does **not** scan for known CVEs or vulnerabilities. Instead, it helps you avoid fake, typo-squatted, or suspicious packages by scoring their trustworthiness. No tool can promise 100% security‚ÄîPkgGuard is your smart first line of defense, not a silver bullet. Use it as a savvy dev, and always review critical dependencies!

## üó∫Ô∏è High-Level Architecture
![PkgGuard Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shafnir/PkgGuard/refs/heads/main/docs/architecture.png)

## ‚ú® Features
- **Trust Badges:** Inline trust scores for every import in your code.
- **Risk Factors:** See why a package is risky (e.g., single maintainer, outdated, low downloads).
- **Direct Links:** Jump straight to PyPI, npm, or GitHub from your editor.
- **Ignore/Unignore:** Instantly ignore packages you trust (or unignore them) with a click.
- **Smart Caching:** Fast, efficient, and respects your workflow‚Äîno unnecessary network calls.
- **No Telemetry:** Your code and data never leave your machine.

## üß† How It Works
1. Detects imports in Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript files.
2. Fetches metadata from PyPI, npm, and GitHub.
3. Calculates a trust score and highlights risks directly in your editor.
4. Lets you take action‚Äîignore, review, or research‚Äîwithout leaving VS Code.

## üïπÔ∏è Usage
- **Hover** over any import to see its trust score, risk factors, and direct links.
- **Ignore/Unignore** a package: Click the "Ignore package" or "Unignore package" link in the hover UI.
- **Clear cache:** Run the `PkgGuard: Clear Cache` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
- **Toggle PkgGuard:** Click the shield icon in the status bar to enable or disable the extension instantly.

## üîí Why PkgGuard?
- **Security-first:** Know your dependencies before you `pip install` or `npm install`.
- **Open, transparent, and privacy-respecting.**
- **Designed for modern devs:** Fast, beautiful, and non-intrusive.
